/*
	Quick Sort:
	Runtime: O(n log(n)) average, O(n^2) worst case
	Memory: O(log(n))

	In quick sort, we pick a random element and partition the array, such that all numbers that are
	less than the partitioning element come before all elements that are greater than it. The partitioning
	can be performed efficiently through a series of swaps.

	If we repeatedly partition the array (and its sub-arrays) around an element, the array will
	eventually become sorted. However, as the partitioned element is not guaranteed to be the median
	(or anywhere near the median), our sorting could be very slow. This is the reason for the O(n^2)
	runtime.
